# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I am an [Engineering Manager at DigitalOcean](), a company that simplifies cloud computing so developers and businesses can spend more time creating software that changes the world.

## passions
* **voice computing** - I wrote [Introduction to Voice Computing in Python](https://neurolex.ai/voicebook), a starter book for voice developers.
* **quantum computing** - I co-founded [QuForce.org](https://quforce.org), a community for quantum computing enthusiasts.
* **climate change activism** - I helped to build the website for [ClimateVoice](https://climatevoice.org), an advocacy organization to go #AllinonClimate and built a few GitHub applications through [Protea.earth](https://github.com/protea-earth), a working group for climate change.
