## [passions I code around](https://jim.schwoebel.me)
* **climate change activism** - Previously, I was Head of Engineering at [NewAtlantis Labs](https://www.newatlantis.io/), a team dedicated to merging omics-led science, AI, and innovative financial models to support Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). I also helped to build the website for [ClimateVoice](https://climatevoice.org), an advocacy organization to go #AllinonClimate and built a few climate GitHub applications through [Protea.earth](https://github.com/protea-earth), a working group for climate change.
* **databases** - Our team @ DigitalOcean built the [managed databases product (DBaaS)](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases) to make it easy to set up and scale SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis databases (10+ team members).
* **digital health** - I'm a strong believer that [software can eat healthcare a bit more](https://rockhealth.com/rock-weekly/all-eyes-on-you-2022/) to improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs; it's our responsibility to make the healthcare transition toward web 3.0 move faster.
* **diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)** - I strongly believe software can help improve accessibility and lessen biases, so if I can contribute to any DEI-related projects you are working on please let me know.
* **life hacking** - I generally am looking for hacks to be more productive, so you may find me releasing some code to automate my daily routine and/or send and respond to emails.
* **machine learning** - I built [Allie](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie), an agile ML framework (90+ stars) - I'm always looking to open source useful machine learning models and [teach others machine learning who want to learn](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voice_gender_detection).
* **new media formats** - I'm fascinated about creating new forms of art and media formats through software -- for example, [computer generated poetry](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voicebook/blob/master/chapter_5_generation/generate_poem.py).
* **quantum computing** - I co-founded [QuForce.org](https://quforce.org), a community for quantum computing enthusiasts.
* **stock trading** - I like to do automated stock trading or portfolio analysis, so I may release some projects in the open source community soon.
* **voice computing** - I [wrote a book in voice computing](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voicebook) and I've mentored 40+ fellows in voice computing through our [innnovation fellows program](https://neurolex.ai/research).
* **web 3.0** - As a full-stack developer, I'm particularly excited about helping to build [Web 3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) at the intersection of voice computing, blockchain, NFTs, machine learning, gamification, virtual reality, and quantum computing.
