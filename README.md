Currently, I am an [Engineering Manager at DigitalOcean](https://jim.schwoebel.me), a company that simplifies cloud computing so developers and businesses can spend more time creating software that changes the world.

Our team @ DigitalOcean (DO) is helping to build the [managed databases product (DBaaS)](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases) to make it easy to set up and scale SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis databases.

## [passions I code around](https://jim.schwoebel.me)
* **voice computing** - I've mentored 40+ fellows in voice computing through our [innnovation fellows program](https://neurolex.ai/research).
* **databases** - our team @ DigitalOcean is helping to build the [managed databases product (DBaaS)](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases) to make it easy to set up and scale SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis databases (10+ team members).
* **machine learning** - I built [Allie](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie), an agile ML framework (90+ stars) - I'm always looking to [teach others machine learning who want to learn too](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voice_gender_detection).
* **quantum computing** - I co-founded [QuForce.org](https://quforce.org), a community for quantum computing enthusiasts.
* **climate change activism** - I helped to build the website for [ClimateVoice](https://climatevoice.org), an advocacy organization to go #AllinonClimate and built a few climate GitHub applications through [Protea.earth](https://github.com/protea-earth), a working group for climate change.
* **stock trading** - I like to do automated stock trading or portfolio analysis, so I may release some projects in the open source community soon.
* **diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)** - I strongly believe software can help improve accessibility and lessen biases, so if I can contribute to any DEI-related projects you are working on please let me know! 
* **web development** - I enjoy building web frameworks and applications as a full-stack developer - most recently [vibe.cards](https://vibe.cards) to create/distibute voice cards. I'm particularly excited about Web 3.0 enabled by Blockchain and quantum computing.
