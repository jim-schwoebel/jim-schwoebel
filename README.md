## passions
* **voice computing** - I wrote [Introduction to Voice Computing in Python](https://neurolex.ai/voicebook), a starter book for voice developers.
* **databases** - our team @ DigitalOcean is helping to build the [managed databases product (DBaaS)](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases) to make it easy to set up and scale SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis databases.
* **machine learning** - I built [Allie](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie), an agile ML framework (90+ stars).
* **quantum computing** - I co-founded [QuForce.org](https://quforce.org), a community for quantum computing enthusiasts.
* **climate change activism** - I helped to build the website for [ClimateVoice](https://climatevoice.org), an advocacy organization to go #AllinonClimate and built a few climate GitHub applications through [Protea.earth](https://github.com/protea-earth), a working group for climate change.
